# anki-creator

Service to, from a list of topics, interactively create Anki cards.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add cards programmatically
- [ ] Generate cards with ICL
- [ ] Straight go
- [ ] Optimize the above (with creating mutliple cards)
- [ ] See output before it's inputted and be able to edit the above from a frontend (with latex rendering)

Nice-to-have
- [ ] List all cards in a deck
